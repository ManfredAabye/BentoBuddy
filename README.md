# Disclosure

I do not maintain this software or moderate this repository in any way, I am only hosting these files on GitHub because it is needlessly difficult to find the source code for the GNU GPL v3 licensed Bento Buddy blender plugin outside of a paywall on the Second Life grid.

That said:

Remember that when we talk about "free software" with licenses like the GNU GPL v3, we're talking about "free as in freedom", not "free as in beer". The time and effort needed to write a useful and feature rich software product is not without value. If you have experimented with this software and find it useful for any purpose, I encourage you to support the authors by purchasing the product from their store on the grid.
